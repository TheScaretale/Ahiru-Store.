Used tech: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


This was a project I modified from the NLW 6th edition by Rocketseat, it's also my first website.

Here's the template layout we used, I modified some bits: https://www.figma.com/file/EiWG50HAyrdq9mhZy7BQvS/Origin-Six-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1

This site is a gift I made to a friend.
